Arrow Heart Drawing using Python Turtle

This project is a Python program that draws a heart-shaped pattern using mathematical functions and the Turtle graphics module.  
The heart is generated using parametric equations based on sine and cosine functions.

The program uses the math library for calculations and turtle for graphical rendering.  
A black background with a violet heart gives a smooth and visually appealing animation.

Requirements
Python 3.x
turtle module (comes pre-installed with Python)
math module

How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed on your system
2. Save the file as arrowheart.py
3. Run the program using:
   python arrowheart.py
4. A Turtle graphics window will open and draw the heart animation

Concepts Used
Python functions
Loops
Mathematical equations
Turtle graphics

Purpose
This project is created for learning and demonstration purposes, combining mathematics with Python graphics to create visual patterns.
